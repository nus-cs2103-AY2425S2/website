Due to holidays, **this week's tutorial is released as a pre-recorded video**.

{{ panopto("6c3474d0-0e20-4416-ad74-b13c0138d3a6", desc="Week 10 - Tutorial") }}

What you need to do:

1. Have a look at the three tutorial tasks given below in this page. It is best if you attempt them first, before you start watching the video.
1. Watch the video, and do the tasks as the video instructs you %%(e.g., answer in-video questions, post screenshots in the workspace file)%%.
1. If you have doubts or questions, post in your tutorials MSTeam channel (and tag the tutor), or post in the course forum.

**:fas-clock: Period to watch the video** (to be ==counted for tutorial participation==): {{ get_date(date_w10_start, -2, time="")}} -- <span class="text-danger">{{ get_date(date_w10_start, 8, time="23:59")}}</span>

#### {{ thumb(1) }} Demonstrate an assertion failure

* Task: Demonstrate an assertion failure using your tP code.
* Objective: to verify that assertions are being checked when you run the code locally.

Here are the steps:

1. Java assertions are not enabled by default.
   * If using Gradle to run your app, [check if your `build.gradle` has been updated to enable assertions](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html#enabling-assertions).<br>
     If needed, update it as necessary.
   * If using Intellij's native features to run your app (i.e., `Gradle` is not selected in this [setting](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/images/gradle/intellijRunUsingGradle.png)), [check if you have enabled assertions in IntelliJ settings](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijUsefulSettings.html).
1. Modify the code of your tP to deliberately cause an assertion failure<br>
   e.g., add `assert false;`{.java} somewhere in your code.
1. Run the code so that the application crashes with an assertion failure.
1. Take a ==screenshot that shows the assertion error message== and save it somewhere. During the tutorial, the tutor will ask you to paste it in the tutorial workspace document.


#### {{ thumb(2) }} Give examples of defensive programming

* Note down examples of _defensive programming_ from AB3 or your tP.<br>
  During the tutorial, the tutor will ask you for these examples.


#### {{ thumb(3) }} Review sample <tooltip content="Developer Guide">DG</tooltip> extracts

* Download the sample DG extracts in `T10-DG-Extracts.pdf` (in [Canvas/Files]({{ url_files }})/Handouts).
* Evaluate the given extract to find errors or areas to improve. Note them down (e.g., add comments to the PDF file).
* In particular, detect the following DG bugs (they are the same bugs against which your final DG will be evaluated).

* During the tutorial, the tutor will ask you for the observations you've noted down.
